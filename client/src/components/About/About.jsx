      <p>
        Hello, my name is Efren Mar√≠n. I am 20 years old and I am a student with
        the goal of becoming a Full Stack programmer at Soy Henry. Currently, I
        am studying the bootcamp and, at the same time, learning German
        independently from my home country, Mexico.

        I consider myself an inherently curious person, with an insatiable
        thirst for knowledge. In addition to my focus on technology and
        programming, I also have a deep interest in areas such as politics,
        philosophy, psychology, and physics.
